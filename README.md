## Initialization Function

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the Expert Advisor. It checks if trading is allowed and returns `INIT_FAILED` if not.

## Start Function

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the market. It first checks if the maximum number of positions have been taken. If so, it returns. Then, it calculates the trend tops and bottoms using the `CalculateTrendTop` and `CalculateTrendBottom` functions. It checks if the current price is at a trend top or bottom using the `IsCurrentPriceAtTrendTop` and `IsCurrentPriceAtTrendBottom` functions. If so, it attempts to open a new position using the `OpenPosition` function. It then checks for stop loss and take profit using the `CheckStopLoss` and `CheckTakeProfit` functions.

## Calculation Functions

The `CalculateTrendTop` and `CalculateTrendBottom` functions implement sophisticated arithmetic algorithms to identify trend tops and bottoms respectively.

## Helper Functions

The `IsCurrentPriceAtTrendTop` and `IsCurrentPriceAtTrendBottom` functions implement logic to check if the current price is at a trend top or bottom respectively.

## Position Functions

The `OpenPosition` function calculates the position size based on available free margin and opens a new position using the calculated position size. It returns true if the position is successfully opened.

The `CheckStopLoss` and `CheckTakeProfit` functions implement logic to check if the stop loss or take profit levels are reached for any open positions respectively.

## Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit` function is called during the deinitialization of the Expert Advisor. It closes any remaining open positions.
